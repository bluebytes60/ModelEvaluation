# ModelEvaluation

This repository contains the scripts and codes that our science team uses for evaluating the bid models.

compare_models.Turn.R implements the model evaluation methodology represented in "Online Model Evaluation in a Large-Scale Computational Advertising Platform" authored by Shahriar Shariat, Burkay Orten and Ali Dasdan and published in the proceedings of ICDM 2015. The sample dataset does not replicate the one used in the paper and is scrampled and randomized to comply with company's policies.
